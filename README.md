# [myrmoa.github.io](http://myrmoa.github.io)
An angular web application I developed to host my developer portfolio and to give Github Actions a try. 

## Deploys
Any commits to develop kickoff the Github Actions [Build & Deploy](https://github.com/MyrmoA/myrmoa.github.io/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+%26+Deploy%22) workflow.

## Tests
Any commits pushed to the repository kick off the Github Actions [Run Tests](https://github.com/MyrmoA/myrmoa.github.io/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Run+Tests%22) workflow.

## Notes
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.
